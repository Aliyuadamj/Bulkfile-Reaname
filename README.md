program to create a file renaming system that provides a simple and intuitive Graphical User Interface(GUI) for batch renaming files based on user-defined criteria.
And also to create a folder creation system for easy creation of folders by the user.
used qt designer to create custom GUI for this program
install pyqt5: pip install pyqt5
installed pyinstaller to make like an application as sun as clicked to run: pip install pyinstaller
create the dist and build file using this command: python -m PyInstaller bulkfile.py --onefile --windowed
used PyInstaller to be able to run my code as a .exe file
note for some weird reason my .exe file was not able to run anywhere else except in the program folder
